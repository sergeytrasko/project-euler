# Project Euler Problem 84 - Monopoly odds

## Solution idea

Actually there is not much of the algorithms used. We just need to implemet simulation of the game according to the rules.

I decided to go with 1'000'000 moves simulation (i.e. roll 2 4-sided dices one million times) and check how many times the player visits a particular cell.

In the end we just need to choose 3 that have most visits.
