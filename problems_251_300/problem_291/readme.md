# Project Euler Problem 291 - Panaitopol Primes

[https://projecteuler.net/problem=291](https://projecteuler.net/problem=29)

## Solution idea

Quick googling revealed that Panaitopol primes are primes of form `n^2 + (n+1)^2`.

The rest is trivial brute-force.

However the solution is quite slow - it took me around 5 minutes to get to the answer.
