# Project Euler Solutions

## Things I learned solving Project Euler problems

- Programming language is not important, I chose golang but I could have achieved the same results with any other language
- First 50 or so problems can be solved without knowing anything about algorithms - mostly brute-force solutions are viable
- The bigger the problem number, the more complex they are. I.e. 5% problem from first hundred problems is much easier than 5% problem from 7-th hundred

## My strategy

- Don't look for solutions - try to solve it myself first
- Try to figure out algorithm complexity beforehand. Efficient algorithm for Project Euler problem should check at most 50'000'000 possibilities (to fit into recommended time limit of 1 minute). For example if I see that need to find sum of numbers below 10^7 - it gives a clue that every number should be checked in constant time (i.e. O(1))
- One cannot know all algorithms - it's OK to google algorithms and ideas of solutions
- After I solved the problem I try to google solutions of other people to verify my ideas and learn something from others
- Project Euler opens you an internal discussion thread for a problem once you solve it - it's good to check other people ideas there.
