# Project Euler Problem 19 - Counting Sundays

[https://projecteuler.net/problem=19](https://projecteuler.net/problem=19)

## Solution idea

This is a problem where I cheated again - just used golang date-time functions (from `time` package).

## Alternative solutions

I think the expected solution would be to calculate how many Sundays are there every year. The major trick would be to deal with leap years.
