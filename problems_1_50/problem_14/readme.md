# Project Euler Problem 14 - Longest Collatz sequence

[https://projecteuler.net/problem=14](https://projecteuler.net/problem=14)

## Solution idea

I did not have any better idea than just iterate from 1 to a million, generate Collatz sequence for every of the numbers and check for maximum length.
