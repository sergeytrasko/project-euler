# Project Euler Problem 4 - Largest palindrome product

[https://projecteuler.net/problem=4](https://projecteuler.net/problem=4)

## Solution idea

Problem statement already gives a clue to solution - we need to iterate from 100 to 999 twice and cross-multiply the numbers.
After it we need to check if the number is a palindrome.

In this problem I'm just converting number to string and checking the digits from two sides.

## Alternative solutions

I think it is the way to go and I doubt that there is a better solution.
