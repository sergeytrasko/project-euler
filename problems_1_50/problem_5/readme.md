# Project Euler Problem 5 - Smallest multiple

[https://projecteuler.net/problem=5](https://projecteuler.net/problem=5)

## Solution idea

I brute-forced this problem - just iterated through numbers and checked if it is divisible from 2 till 20

## Alternative solutions

We can find prime factors of 2 to 20: 2, 3, 2*2, 5, 2*3, 7, 2*2*2, 3*3, 2*5, 11, 2*2*3, 13, 2*7, 3*5, 2*2*2*2, 17, 2*3*3, 19, 2*2*5
Now we can make observation that the result should be disible by 2*2*2*2, by 3*3, by 5, by 7, by 11, by 13, by 17 and by 19.
So just multiply these factors and you will get an answer - basically pen and paper approach.
