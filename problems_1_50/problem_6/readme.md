# Project Euler Problem 6 - Sum square difference

[https://projecteuler.net/problem=6](https://projecteuler.net/problem=6)

## Solution idea

Brute-force solution - iterate from 1 to 100 and calculate both sums. Then find the difference between them

## Alternative solutions

There is a know formula for sum of first N numbers - N*(N+1)/2
Also there is a formula for sum of squares of first N numbers - N*(N+1)*(2N+1)/6

Basically it gives us constant time solution.
