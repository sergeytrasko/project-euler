# Project Euler Problem 3 - Largest prime factor

[https://projecteuler.net/problem=3](https://projecteuler.net/problem=3)

## Solution idea

Another brute-force problem.
It is known that any prime factor of N should be less or equal to square root of N.

For this problem we need to check if a number is a prime. 

## Alternative solutions

The function to check prime numbers is not optimal - in other problems a better version will be used.
