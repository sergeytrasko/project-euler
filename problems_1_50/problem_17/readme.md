# Project Euler Problem 17 - Number letter counts

[https://projecteuler.net/problem=17](https://projecteuler.net/problem=17)

## Solution idea

This is a problem where you need to know how to spell numbers in English.

I wrote a function that would spell a number according to English rules - basically convert number to a string.

Then I remove all spaces and hypes from the string and take its length.

Sum of all lengths will be the answer.

Actually I struggled with this problem for some time because it requires very careful spelling. I as non-native English speaker made a typo (extra letter) and spend hours trying to figure out what is wrong with my algorithm.
