# Project Euler Problem 25 - 1000-digit Fibonacci number

[https://projecteuler.net/problem=25](https://projecteuler.net/problem=25)

## Solution idea

Also very simple problem that can be solved using long arithmetics (using golang's `big` package).

We just need to calculate Fibonacci numbers until one of them becomes a 1000-digit number. Good news is that it happens quite early.
