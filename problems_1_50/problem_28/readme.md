# Project Euler Problem 28 - Number spiral diagonals

[https://projecteuler.net/problem=28](https://projecteuler.net/problem=28)

## Solution idea

I implemented a logic to fill the 1001 by 1001 square according to the logics. And then calculated sum of diaginals.
In total it gives around 1 million elements in the grid so it is doable in reasonable time

## Alternative solutions

If you look cafefully at the grid, you can see that diagnonal elements have certain pattern and they can be calculated based on n - layer number.
In this way we can get a linear solution and constant memory allocation.
