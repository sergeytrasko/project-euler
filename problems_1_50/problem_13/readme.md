# Project Euler Problem 13 - Large sum

[https://projecteuler.net/problem=13](https://projecteuler.net/problem=13)

## Solution idea

I think I cheated here as I used golang's big package that provides functions to work with long integers.

## Alternative solutions

I assume problem authors expected that you need to implement a subset of long arithmetics library. For example - read two strings from a file, parse them into 2 arrays of digits and sum them as you do it on paper (from right to left and deal with carry if needed).
