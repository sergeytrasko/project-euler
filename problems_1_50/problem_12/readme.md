# Project Euler Problem 12 - Highly divisible triangular number

[https://projecteuler.net/problem=12](https://projecteuler.net/problem=12)

## Solution idea

Triangular numbers have the formula `T(n) = n*(n+1)/2`

Note that `n` and `(n+1)` are co-prime numbers meaning that they will have different divisors.

This means that we can reduce the complexity of the problem to count divisors by just counting divisors of `n` and of `n+1`
