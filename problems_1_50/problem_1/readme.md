# Project Euler Problem 1 - Multiples of 3 or 5

[https://projecteuler.net/problem=1](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1)

## Solution idea

Just iterate from 1 to 1000, check if number can be divided by 3 or 5. And if yes - add to the sum.

## Alternative solutions

Multiples of 3 form an arithmetic sequence - there is a formula to find sum of arithmetic sequence. Same for multiples of 5.
And we should exclude multiples of 15 that we counted twice.
