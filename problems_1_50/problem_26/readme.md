# Project Euler Problem 26 - Reciprocal cycles

[https://projecteuler.net/problem=26](https://projecteuler.net/problem=26)

## Solution idea

In this problem we need to code integer division in a way it is done with pen and paper.

The tricky part is to understand where the cycle starts and ends. Actually it is very simple - when doing the division we remember all the reminders. Once we get the remainder that we saw before - it means that there is a cycle.
